# Get Started

Add the Rewind component library to your project to use the components.

## Install

```
yarn add rewind-components -S
```
or if you are using NPM:
```
npm install rewind-components --save
```

## Usage

All the components in Rewind are exported from the base component. You can import only the ones you need and so not load unused components in your production bundle.

## Browser support

Rewind Components are supported in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 11, and Microsoft Edge.
